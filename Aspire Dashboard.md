- **Resources**: Lists the containers, projects, and executables that make up your entire cloud-native app. Use the links in the **Endpoints** column to connect to each microservice.
- **Console**: Displays the text sent to standard output from the integration you specify.
- **Structured logs**: Displays information sent to OpenTelemetry loggers.
- **Traces**: Displays a trace for each request received by any microservice in the app.
